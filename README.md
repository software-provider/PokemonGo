# PokemonGoDesktop.Unity.Game [Project Closing]

#**I've decided to end this project due to the action Tom has been taking against developers in the community. This is a fully functional base layer for what is required to build a Pokemon Go client that connects to the offical servers in Unity3D. You can see examples of how request/response handling is implemented in the game repo. I will be moving on to an IRL MMO project similar to Pokemon Go which will be open-source if you're interested.**

PokemonGoDesktop.Unity.Game is an Implementation of the PokemonGoDesktop.API and PokemonGoDesktop.Unity. Based on PokemonGoDesktop.Unity's net35 async/await and callback-based HTTP handling on the main thread.

This project is licensed under the GPL.
